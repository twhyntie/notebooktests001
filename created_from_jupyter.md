# Introduction
This is a a notebook created from the web interface after typing:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
That's pretty nifty.

```{.python .input  n=1}
print("This works!")
```

```{.json .output n=1}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "This works!\n"
 }
]
```

And this is a _second_ cell with `Markdown`.

```{.python .input}

```
